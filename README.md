# Party-Planer
Simple fun and learning way to use Windows Form

This is a simple "Party Planer" for a little project I had to do, an easy way to learn Windows Forms in VS

So we tell the program how many people we want to come to the party, and we assign a cost and fee price for each person, once we click "Create List" we will then create a list of X amount of people. Our Invite Guest group will then be available so we can put in each First name and Last name for each guest, we can't add more than our Set X amount of guests. So if we have 10 guests on our list we can only add up to 10 or fewer.

We can check how much of our total cost and the total fee will be once each person is added, same with the Surplus.

Every guest will be shown in our Guest list and can then be changed or deleted from the list.
